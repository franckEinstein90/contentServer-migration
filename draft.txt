Complete classification import for target prefixes
1. How to compare what has been imported to what's in iRims

Problem: Importing classification information in GCDocs is prone to error and therefore typically has to be done in batches.
It's easy to lose track of what has been successfully imported, especially given the size of the data sets, which are typically composed of tens of thousands of records.

GCDocs has a facility to export classification plans, but it is often unwieldy, in a format that doesn't lend itself well to data manipulation, for example for comparison purposes (excel).  

In this article a method and associated script is presented to grab information directly of the classification screen in GCDocs.
